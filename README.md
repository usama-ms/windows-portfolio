### Flow Explanation:

1. The application starts with the main App component which manages the overall state.
2. Initially, the LoginScreen is displayed.
3. After login, the Desktop, Taskbar, and potentially the StartMenu are rendered.
4. The Desktop contains DesktopIcons and can open Windows.
5. Windows can contain various content components like browsers, folders, etc.
6. The Taskbar shows active applications and allows switching between them.
7. The StartMenu provides access to all applications.

## 🔍 State Management

The application uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management. Key states include:

- `isLoggedIn`: Tracks whether the user has logged in
- `openWindows`: Tracks which windows are currently open
- `activeWindow`: Tracks which window is currently active/focused
- `minimizedWindows`: Tracks which windows are minimized
- `startMenuOpen`: Tracks whether the Start Menu is open

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes:

- On larger screens, the full Windows 10 desktop experience is provided
- On smaller screens, certain elements are adjusted or hidden to maintain usability
- The taskbar adapts to show fewer items on mobile devices
